#  Task 1 - Data Visualization (Bar Chart / Histogram)

*Internship Role*: Data Science Intern  
*Company*: Prodigy InfoTech  
*Task*: Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable (e.g., gender or age).

---

##  Objective

The aim of this task is to understand and demonstrate basic data visualization using Python. Visualization is a key skill in Data Science, helping to uncover insights in a dataset.

---

##  Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn (optional)

---

##  Dataset

I used a *custom synthetic dataset* (created using Python) that simulates a population of 100 people with their:
- Age
- Gender

You can also use your own dataset or download from open sources.

---

##  Output

1. *Bar Chart* - Gender distribution (Male vs Female)
2. *Histogram* - Age distribution (e.g., how many people fall into certain age groups)

---

##  Key Learnings

- How to load and explore datasets using pandas
- Creating visualizations using matplotlib
- Understanding distribution of variables in a population
- Saving .ipynb work and uploading to GitHub
